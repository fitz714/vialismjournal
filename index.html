[Entry #1 - January 3rd
Truce

	I don’t know if writing this is a mistake. If the wrong person finds it, I’ll be labeled as a traitor. Weak. A defective mind. But Clancy always says that we must keep records, even if it’s just for ourselves, so here I am. Dema is quiet tonight. Too quiet. The towers loom over us, their shadows stretching endlessly across the city like waiting hands. The air is thick with something that can’t be put into words, a weight pressing down on the streets and our minds. The Bishops, the nine leaders who govern Dema, say silence is peace, but I know better. Silence in Dema means someone is gone. 
	Clancy understands what Dema does to people. He tells us there’s another way, though I’ve never seen it with my own eyes. Still, I believe him. I have to. When he speaks, at secret gatherings around town, the cracks in the city seem real—like maybe the walls aren’t as strong as they seem from the outside. 
	I wonder, does he ever doubt himself? If the weight of leading this resistance makes him question everything? I hope not. Because if Clancy starts to waver, then what hope do the rest of us have? 

Entry #2 - March 10th
Neon Gravestones

	I lost someone today. Not to death, though there’s little difference. Talin was strong, probably stronger than me. For months, we whispered about escaping. Getting out. She believed in Clancy, maybe even more than I do. She said his words made her feel alive, like something was finally beneath the crushing weight of living in a place like this. 
But today when I looked for her, she was gone. A neighbor said she had gone to the Temple last night, that she had chosen peace. I don’t believe that. I’ve seen it happen a couple times before—people enter the Temple, and they come out… changed. It’s the place where dissenters are taken to be re-educated and controlled. Hollow-eyed, voices drained of fight. Some of them never came out at all. Talin is gone, and I don’t even know if she knew it was happening before it was too late. Is Clancy’s voice really loud enough? Are the Banditos truly stronger than Dema? Or is it just… noise? 

No. No. I went to the rally tonight. Clancy stood above us, surrounded by flames, yellow tape across his chest, and I swear I felt something more than the fire. He said we are more than what they make us. That hope is not foolishness. That we are meant to fight. And for a moment, I believed it. But when I looked past him, beyond the edge of the crowd, I saw something else. 
The Bishops were watching. They weren’t afraid. They just stood there. Are we winning? Or are they simply waiting?

Entry #3 - April 16th
Holding On To You

Clancy is winning. I have to believe that. I heard someone say today that the Bishops are watching more closely. That curfews are tighter, that more people are being taken to the Temple, a few of them willingly. But that isn’t a sign of their control strengthening. It’s desperation. They’re afraid. A few people in my District stopped wearing yellow. I asked why, but their eyes darted away, and they muttered something about not wanting trouble. I refuse to listen to that fear. Clancy says we have to keep fighting, even in the smallest ways. I still wear yellow. I still whisper the truth to those willing to listen. We are still here. Talin would have stayed with me. If she hadn’t let the doubt in, she would still be here. I know what happens when doubt creeps in. It eats away at you, until Dema swallows you whole. So I won’t let it in. I can’t. Clancy will win. We will win.

Entry #4 - May 27th
Not Today

I saw something today that I’m trying to forget. Someone tried to run. I don’t know his name, just that he wore yellow. He was a Bandito. He carried a bag strapped tight across his chest, wrapped in yellow tape. He sprinted for the outer wall, and he truly thought he was gonna make it. I thought he would make it too. East is Up. The rain masked his footsteps, muffled the sound of his breath as he pushed forward, faster and faster until sirens cut through the sky. The Bishops didn’t chase him. They didn’t need to. I’m not sure how they did it, but from the graves at the edge of the city, bodies rose. They were the Glorious Gone, those taken by the Bishops and reanimated as silent, obedient guardians of Dema, They swarmed the Bandito. He tried to run, but was dragged towards the Temple. And then he was gone. Just gone. People whispered about it later, whispers in corners, hushed voices between walls, but it didn’t last. Dema doesn’t like when we dwell on things like this. Clancy says escape is possible, that he’s done it before. He says that freedom exists. So maybe this was just… just a mistake. A miscalculation. Maybe he wasn’t fast enough. Maybe he took the wrong route. Maybe if I ever tried, it would be different. But that thought… it doesn’t settle in my mind the way it used to. 

Entry #5 - June 13th
Leave The City

I’ve never seen a rally this big before. Tonight, Clancy stood before hundreds, maybe even thousands of us. The yellow banners stretched across the plaza, spilling over rooftops, fluttering against the night sky like defiance itself. It was loud. Louder than Dema has ever allowed us to be. Clancy spoke like the fire was alive in him. He didn’t just say that we could escape—he said we would. That the Bishops were weakening, that their grip wasn’t unbreakable, that we had seen the cracks in their control and it was time to widen them. I believed him, we all did. When he raised his hand, the crowd surged forward, chanting, screaming, lifting yellow scarves and fabrics toward the sky like they could tear down the walls themselves. The moment felt real. Like history was shifting beneath our feet. 

And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, it ended. No warning, no announcement, just silence. In the days after, Clancy was gone. Rumors spread like wildfire— some say he made it out. That this was his moment, that the rally was his way of telling us he was leaving. Others claim the Bishops took him, dragged him deep into the heart of Dema, into places where nobody comes back from. I refuse to believe that. He made it out. He must have. 

But if he did, why does the city feel… different? The streets are quieter. People are afraid to talk. I still wear yellow, but I’m one of the few. One of the proud. One of the emotional. I tell myself it’s because they miss him. That they feel lost without his words. But somewhere deep inside me, there’s another thought, one I am hesitant to write. If Clancy really escaped, why does it feel like the Bishops aren’t really worried? 

Entry #6 - August 9th
Choker

	Clancy returned today. 
I should feel relieved, I should feel overjoyed. But I don’t. Because the man who stood before us today was not the man I saw at the rally in June. The Bishops let him speak—but there were no yellow banners this time. No chants. No fire. Just cold calculated words echoing through the square. He told us that escape was never real. That resistance was a lie, that we had been misled. That there was real peace in Dema, if we only accepted it. His voice was steady, his expression blank. I tried to convince myself—he was forced to say this. He had no choice. This isn’t real. But his words settled over the crowd like a fog, and no one challenged him. 

	No one dared to. Afterward, I wandered the streets, expecting whispers. Expecting outrage. But there was only silence. The few who still wore yellow… most of them took it off, and locked it away. I didn’t, but for the first time, I wondered if I should. 

Entry #7 - October 14th
Bandito

	Yellow is fading. I still wear it. But these days, it feels more like a funeral colour than a rebellion. Clancy’s words have settled over Dema like a weighted blanket—smooth, suffocating, final. I don’t know if people truly believe him, or if they simply don’t care anymore. Maybe that’s worse. 

	He did a performance with Torchbearer a few days ago. Thousands turned out to see them, myself included. I wish I hadn’t. The stage was massive, stretching across the square in a way that felt deliberate—like it was built not just for music, but for control. The Bishops stood along the edges, watching, but they never spoke. They didn’t need to. Their presence was enough. Clancy sang. The words were hollow, polished, rehearsed. There was no fire in his voice—no cracks in his expression. He didn’t fight the lyrics, but he didn’t embrace them either. Just... empty compliance. And yet, there was one moment—so brief I almost convinced myself I imagined it. As one song ended, Torchbearer turned toward him, eyes expectant, waiting for the next verse. But Clancy hesitated—just for a fraction of a second, just long enough for his breath to falter. The crowd didn’t notice. But I did. And then it was gone. The hesitation vanished, swallowed by the rhythm, buried under the weight of the Bishops' watchful eyes. People cheered. They raised their voices, their arms, their hearts. Some even sang along. I didn’t. 

	I used to whisper about escape. I used to tell myself that if I ran fast enough, if I planned well enough, I could get out. That we all could. But now? Now I don’t whisper anything at all. It’s not fear anymore. It’s exhaustion. I wonder if this is how it starts. If this is how people disappear—not through violence, and not through force, but simply by losing themselves piece by piece until nothing is left to fight with. I wanted to be a Bandito. But now, I think I’m just waiting to fade. 

Entry #8 - November 26th
Glowing Eyes

	I finally saw Talin again today. 
But it wasn’t really her. She sat at the edge of the square, unmoving, staring at nothing, surrounded by people who didn’t even acknowledge her. It was as if she had already ceased to exist, long before they decided to bury her. I watched them lift the neon gravestone, placing it where she would rest. The glow reflected in her empty eyes, a quiet acceptance flickering in her expression. She didn’t resist. She didn’t even react. No words, no movement, no fear. 

	I wondered if, somewhere deep inside, she understood what was happening. If she recognised that she was about to disappear forever, that soon, her name would fade from memory, just like all the others who came before her. Maybe she did. Or maybe she stopped caring long ago. Either way, the result was the same. I stood there, long after they left. Long after the square emptied, after the last flicker of yellow faded into the streets. Long after Talin was gone. I thought about how I used to whisper of escape. How I used to hold onto the idea that we could win. That there was something beyond these walls, waiting for me. 

	I don’t think that anymore. I took off my yellow scarf today. Folded it carefully, and tucked it away. It doesn’t matter anymore. I walked home without looking back. I think tomorrow, I’ll go to the Temple. 

Entry #9 - December 31st
Redecorate

	I cleaned my room today. Folded everything carefully. Pushed my journal to the back of the drawer. Tucked away the loose pages, the scribbled thoughts. There was dust on the window ledge. I wiped it away, watched as it disappeared into the air, floating for a second before settling somewhere unseen. The city is quiet tonight. The streets are empty, the lights dim. Clancy says—the Bishops say, this is peace. This is what we were meant for. I understand now. I think I was always meant to be here, be this way. I feel lighter. Clearer. Like I have finally accepted something that was waiting for me all along. But sometimes, late at night, I catch myself staring at the space on my wall where the yellow scarf used to hang. And I wonder—just for a second—what it felt like to believe in something more. 

Entry #10 - March 15th. The Next Year.
The Outside

	I wake up before sunrise, just like always. The Temple bells chime precisely nine times. We rise, we dress, we listen. The Bishops speak, their voices smooth, unwavering, guiding us toward clarity. Toward peace. I do not think about Clancy. I do not think about yellow banners, or whispered conversations, or the walls beyond the city. That was before. I understand now. Dema is home. 

	But today, something is different. It starts in quiet murmurs. Short conversations, quickly hushed. Something has happened, though no one dares speak it aloud—not yet. I hear it when walking through a dining room, between neatly placed chairs and soft glowing lights. A phrase, slipping between voices, barely audible. “The wall was breached.” I keep walking. I do not stop. I do not listen. But then, another whisper—”Clancy escaped.” My hands falter slightly at my sides. It’s small. Barely noticeable. I keep walking. I do not react. It does not matter. 

	And yet, when I return to my quarters, I sit at my desk. I stare at the space where my journal used to be—the one I locked away in the drawer, meant to be forgotten. I do not reach for it. But I don’t look away either. 

Entry #11 - March 26th
Shy Away

	The Bishops spoke today. They stood on the balcony, looking down at us, at the city—at the whispers that refused to die. Their words were smooth, sharpened. A warning disguised as guidance. “Clancy is gone—His ideas were poison—Look around, Dema is your peace.” But something was different. Their voices were still calm, still measured, but beneath the surface was something else. Tension. Dema is not supposed to fear its own people. And yet, for the first time, it feels like they do. 

	Curfews tightened overnight. The streets, once filled with murmured conversations are quiet again, but it's artificial. Some have disappeared. No explanations, no warnings, just missing faces. And yet, even in silence, resistance lingers. I passed a conversation near the market. A voice, hushed but certain. “I saw them, the Neds—They were near the outer walls.” Another voice scoffed, “They’re just a myth.” I keep walking. I do not listen. I cannot listen. But tonight, for the first time in months, I feel a shadow of something I can’t name. A thought, distant yet undeniable. I should not be questioning anything. I cannot be questioning anything. And yet, here I am. 

Entry #12 - April 21st
Mulberry Street

	The tension in Dema is growing. It's in the way people move, the way they speak. Fewer whispered conversations behind closed doors—now, they glance at each other in passing, silent conversations condensed into a single look. I tell myself I do not notice. I tell myself I do not care. I’m not supposed to care. But then today I saw something I haven’t seen in months. Yellow. A scarf, tucked around someone’s shoulders, standing near the far end of the square. Just one person, unmoving, eyes set forward, defiant but quiet. 

	I stared for too long. Long enough for something inside me to shift. Then—movement. Two officials approaching, fast, controlled. The person saw them, but they did not run. They didn’t even flinch. The Bishops say peace is silence. But the moment felt louder than anything I’ve heard in weeks. And as I walked away, I realized—

	I never should have stopped wearing yellow. 

Entry #13 - May 24th
Overcompensate

	I heard music today. Not the low, rhythmic chants of the Temple. Not the controlled melodies that had echoed on a massive stage, but something else. Something louder. Sharper. Real. I didn’t go looking for it. But I heard whispers—Clancy and Torchbearer are performing. A theater, hidden beyond the square, its doors thrown open to those willing to listen. I didn’t go inside. I wasn’t allowed to go inside. But I stood near enough to see the red and yellow glow of the lights, near enough to hear the pulse of sound, the crash of drums. Near enough to witness something I told myself I had forgotten. 

	And then—I saw him. Not exactly in the theater, but not exactly somewhere else. It was like the rallies of before—dozens gathered, chanting, moving, believing. Then, just as suddenly as he had appeared, he was gone. His absence was loud—almost louder than his short-lived presence. Dema told us he was gone. I had told myself I had let go. But as I watched the crowd slowly fade into the streets, I realized the truth—I never had. 

Entry #14 - June 6th
Navigating

	I wrote today. For months, I believed that I shouldn’t. That Dema’s peace came from something else. But today, I pulled my journal out of the drawer in my desk, and for the first time in a long time, I let myself think. I went to a rally. I didn’t speak. I barely moved. I stood at the edges, watching, listening—yet somehow, I felt more present than I have in months. Clancy wasn’t there, but he was never meant to be. That’s the thing. He’s in Trench. He’s preparing the Banditos. The crowd knew that. And for the first time, I realized that I did too. It was electrifying. This wasn’t hopelessness. This wasn’t defeat. It was something else. Something building. Something shifting beneath the weight of silence. And when the rally ended, when the crowd started to thin, I saw it—a yellow scarf, left behind on the pavement. I stared at it for a long time. This time—I didn’t walk away. 

Entry #15 - June  21st
Vignette

	It’s strange how small things can change everything. A couple weeks ago, I saw yellow in the square. A scarf. A single person standing still, unafraid. And now—I see more. Not everywhere, not openly, but in the gaps between shadows, and in quick glances exchanged across crowded streets. Yellow returning in fragments, piece by piece. 

	Today I heard something new. Not vague whispers of Clancy’s escape, and not hushed mentions of Trench. A plan. A movement. I heard it while passing near an alley, voices sharp, hurried, but controlled—like they knew time was running out. “Three days from now, the warehouse at the south end. The Bishops won’t expect it.” They were careful. But I wasn’t meant to hear it. 

	And yet, I did. I didn’t stop walking. Didn’t acknowledge it. But when I reached my quarters, I sat at my desk, staring at the surface for too long. Then, slowly, deliberately, I reached into the drawer—the one I hadn’t opened in months. And for the first time in a long time, I put the yellow scarf back on. Not around my neck, not where anyone would see. But tucked into my sleeve, hidden, close. A secret held against my skin like a pulse I had forgotten I had. I know I should tell myself that it means nothing, but deep down, it means everything. 

Entry #16 - June 24th
Levitate

	I didn’t mean to leave. It wasn’t my intention when I arose today, but I don’t regret it. I woke up expecting another silent morning, another measured routine. The warehouse was supposed to be nothing more than a passing thought, a plan I wasn’t a part of. But then—I was there. Not inside, not speaking, just watching. The space was filled with movement—shifting figures, hurried voices, too much urgency for comfort. Something had gone wrong. I don’t know what. I still don’t know. 

	Then—the sirens. Not the Temples' melancholy bells. Not the controlled murmurs of a city maintaining order. Real alarms. Real urgency. Real danger. I moved before I could think. Ran toward an alley, ran toward the square, ran towards home. But I never made it. Because suddenly—I wasn’t running towards Dema anymore. I was running out. Towards Trench. 

	I don’t even remember the exact moment it happened—the second the walls were finally behind me instead of in front. I don’t remember if I hesitated, or if I had one final thought before crossing the threshold into something I wasn’t sure I was ready for. One final thought about what I was to become if I stayed home. The Glorious Gone. All I know is I’m here. And Clancy was right, because I met someone. Someone who knew my name before I even spoke. Torchbearer. 

	He wasn’t what I expected—not a myth, not a legend, not an untouchable force shaped by rebellion. Just a man, tired and worn, but sharp-eyed. Someone who had seen too much and carried it anyway. 
	“You look surprised to be here.” His voice was steady, but there was something beneath it—like he knew what had happened before I could explain. I shook my head. 
	“I think I am.” A pause. Then, a quiet question: 
“Did you mean to leave?” I didn’t answer right away. Because I wasn’t sure. I thought back to the Temple, hiding away my scarf, slowly bringing the journal back, the warehouse, the running, and every rally I had attended. I thought about how I wasn’t meant to be here. Thought about how my feet had carried me forward before my mind could stop them. Finally, I spoke. 
	“Does it matter?” Torchbearer watched me carefully, then gave the smallest nod. 
“No,” he said. “It doesn’t.” 

	And just like that—I knew I wouldn’t go back. 

Entry #17 - June 29th
Level of Concern

	I never thought I’d see Dema from the outside. For so long, I had only known it from within—the walls stretching endlessly upward, the streets pressing inward, the silence settling into every corner like an unavoidable weight. But now, I stand beyond the walls. Freedom feels strange. Not because it isn’t real—it is. I can see it in the way they speak without watching their words, in the way the sky doesn’t feel like it’s pressing down on them. But something hasn’t caught up yet. I sit near the fire, yellow cloth wrapped loosely around my arm. It still doesn’t feel like mine. Torchbearer notices. He watches me carefully, like he’s never seen this before. 
“You don’t talk much.” 
“I didn’t talk much in Dema either.” He gives a small nod, like he understands. 
“Vialism does that,” he says. “Makes you believe silence is peace.” I 
trace my finger over the fabric on my arm, thinking about that. Dema told me silence was survival. That rebellion was dangerous. That freedom was something reckless, something broken, something impossible to hold on to. But I’m here. And somehow—that means I was wrong. Torchbearer doesn’t push me for words. He lets the quiet linger, lets me sit in it without suffocating in it. That’s the difference. 

	But Clancy does speak. He stands near the edge of camp, watching the horizon, watching the distant lights of Dema burning like an omen. 
	“We move at dawn,” he says. “You don’t have to come.” I glance at him, searching for something in his expression—hesitation, uncertainty. But there’s none. He already knows my answer. He sits down across from me, firelight flickering against his face. I’d seen him dozens of times before, be it at rallies in the city, wanted posters on the streets, or during the performance he had been forced to make by the Bishops. By Nico. Yet there’s something about him this time that feels different. He feels more down to Earth, more like a real person who’s trying to do good, not some mythological hero to idolize. 
	“You still feel like Dema has a hold on you, don’t you?” he asks. I exhale, barely a breath. 
“Maybe.” Torchbearer shifts beside me, but doesn’t speak. He allows Clancy to weigh in. 
	“That feeling doesn’t disappear overnight,” Clancy says. “They make you believe that once you leave, you’ll be lost. Like you won’t know how to exist outside their control.” His voice is steady—not comforting exactly, but firm. Certain. 
	“But you’re here,” he continues. “You ran. Not because someone forced you to. Not because you had no other choice. You ran because somewhere inside, you knew that staying meant losing yourself completely.” I turn that over in my mind. Had I really known that? Had I truly understood what I was running toward? Or had I just been escaping blindly, grasping for anything that wasn’t Dema? Torchbearer finally speaks again. 
	“We fight for a future where you don’t have to think about whether you deserve freedom.” I stare at the fire, watching how the flames move—not controlled, not restrained, but alive. I don’t say anything, but in the morning when the Bandito’s begin packing to march on Dema, I stand, and I follow. 

Entry #18 - June 30th
Paladin Strait

	The Banditos move quickly—yellow flashing across the fields of Trench, voices sharp, footsteps steady. No hesitation, no turning back. They see their chance, and they take it. We take it. We can’t be sure if we’ll make it, but we are past the point of no return. We breach the outer corridors. The fight begins. It happens fast. Too fast. The streets erupt—Banditos press forward, the Glorious Gone push back. Dema’s forgotten warriors, shadows of what they once were. Silent, controlled, unwavering. I fight. I move. I do not stop. Until I do. She’s in front of me before I even realise. Talin. Her stance is firm, her expression empty, but I know her. Or I did. The yellow scarf is gone. All of it is gone. Something inside me splinters. The past surges forward—a whisper of memories, a flash of what we were, what we dreamed of, what we tried to be before she disappeared into the system that finally took her. She moves first. I hesitate. And then—Torchbearer. A single nod, small, unspoken. A reminder that hesitation is not survival. I breathe in sharply. And I fight, not because I want to. Not because I don’t care, but because she is already gone. I fight for Talin, and I refuse to let Dema take me too.
